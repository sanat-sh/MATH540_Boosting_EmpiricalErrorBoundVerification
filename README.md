# MATH540_Boosting_EmpiricalErrorBoundVerification
The aim of this project is to perform an empirical error bound verification for boosting ensemble method. Namely, the AdaBoost meta-algorithm with decision tree classifier has been used to model the generated and real-life data; the error of the resulting model has been compared to the theoretical bound derived in the book "Foundations of machine learning" (M. Mohri, A. Rostamizadeh, and A. Talwalkar, 2018). The bound itself as well as the description of the code is given in the accompanying Google Colab file. In short, every cell up to the section empirical bound verification should be run in sequence. Then, the particular cell in either of the remining sections can be compiled depending on the parameter of interest (tree depth or sample size, generated or real-world data).
The project is done within the frames of the course MATH 540: Statistical Learning at Nazarbayev University.
